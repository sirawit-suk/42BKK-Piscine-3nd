### Version v1.0.2
### This is a help from my little hand

Makefile : this is the file that keep all command in it.

Installation:
- Download and insert Makefile to every EX.. for example EX00-EX08 in C00.

Preparation:
- Create main.c with default function main() in it including prototype function of each exercise.
- Create function.c for each exercise.

How to use:
- Run file "make" or "make all" to execute the exercise and check Normiette althogether(fast and easy) (use only this when test)

Detail:
- Run file "make build" to execute only
- Run file "make check" to check Norminette only
- Run file "make rename OLD=oldname NEW=newname"

Tips and Note:
- Try to understand of Makefile do... you will see that this will save a lot of time.
- Don't forget to change parameter and header (F1) of function file after make rename.
- Moulinette DON'T check other file, it's ok if you push other file to repository for checking, result will be OK. (Focus on file Turn in)
- Norminette too, there check only file that Turn in.
- Makefile usually start with 'M' because it will appear first of directory (makefile will also work too) [What Name to Give Your Makefile](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/html_node/Makefile-Names.html#Makefile-Names)
